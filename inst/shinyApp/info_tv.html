<h4>DfT data: vehicle miles travelled</h4>
<p>The DfT report "annual traffic" as vehicle miles travelled in a region or local authority area in a year. The data distinguishes between "all motor vehicles" and "cars and taxis". The calculation is quite straightforward for major roads. Each major road link of known length has a single count point associated with it (for any particular year). Daily traffic volume is calculated for a link by multiplying its count point AADF by the link length. This is then multiplied by 365 to obtain an annual traffic volume. The annual traffic volume of all the links within a region or local authority area are then summed. The process for minor roads is complex as traffic estimates are grown from a baseline that is periodically updated for each minor road class in each local authority - based on changes in traffic flows for a sample of minor road manual counts each year.</p>
<p>
Note: DfT traffic figures at the regional and national level are considered robust, and are reported as National Statistics. Traffic estimates for smaller areas are less robust.

<h4>Derived data: road type</h4>
<p>Although not reported by DfT (other than for regions), it is possible to distinguish between vehicle miles travelled on major and minor roads by calculating the value for major roads (as detailed above) and then subtracting this from the DfT's reported figure for all roads. This derived data should be treated with caution as it may not be robust for smaller areas.</p>

<h4>DfT Local Authorities</h4>
<p>These are either current or historic local authority areas for which the DfT have reported vehicle miles travelled. The split between major and minor roads has been derived from DfT data as described above.</p>
