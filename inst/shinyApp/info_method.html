<h4>DfT count points</h4>
<p>Counts take place at a count point every 1, 2, 4 or 8 years on a neutral day between March and October over a 12 hour period (7am - 7pm). Most counts are manual. A few major roads have automatic counters and some counts are dependent on a neighboring counted link. Various methods are used by the DfT to calculate the AADF for a particular year. The AADFs for minor roads are only calculated for a sample of points each year.</p>

<i>AADF based on: </i>

<dl>
    <dt>Any</dt>
    <dd>All available AADFs for this count point.</dd>

    <dt>Count</dt>
    <dd>AADFs that are based on a count taken in the reported year. The DfT apply an expansion factor to the 12 hour raw count.</dd>

    <dt>Estimate</dt>
    <dd>AADFs that have been estimated for the reported year. For example, by the application of a growth factor to the previous year's AADF or estimated from nearby links.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The DfT indicate that figures based on a "Count" are likely to be more accurate than those based on an “Estimate”. Figures based on an "Estimate" should be used with caution.

<i>Raw counts</i>
<p>These are the unadjusted <i>manual</i> traffic counts recorded by the enumerator for a 12 hour period (7am - 7pm) on the count day. Note: this data is only available for manual counts; no data will be shown for automated counts or counts that are dependent on a counted link.</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Day</dt>
    <dd>Raw count over the 12 hour period.</dd>
    <dt>Hour</dt>
    <dd>Raw count for each hour over the 12 hour period.</dd>
</dl>
